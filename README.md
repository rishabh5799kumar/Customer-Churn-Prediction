# Customer-Churn-Prediction
We'll build a simple model to predict customer churn using the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) . Weâ€™ll use Python tools like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for creating visualizations, and apply a classification algorithm to identify customers who have left.

## Steps Involved to Predict Customer Churn

- Outliers using IQR method
- Cleaning and Transforming Data
    - One-hot Encoding
    - Rearranging Columns
    - Feature Scaling
    - Feature Selection
- Prediction using Logistic Regression
- Prediction using Support Vector Classifier
- Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier
- Prediction using KNN Classifier
